# SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS

Sentiment Analysis (SA) is used to analyze emotions/sentiment behind the customer experience. Such
techniques help in improving customer experience, product quality, crisis management, etc. With the
increased number of feedback data, itâ€™s difficult to conclude the general public opinion manually. To ease
this task as part of this project, we classified opinions from one of the major blogging websites, Twitter
where we have adopted Naive Bayesian Classifier and Logistic Regression. We then compared their
performance based on two metrics: accuracy and f1-score. Experimental results of which can be viewed
under the evaluation column. Moreover, this designed system is also capable of guiding its user to make
improvised operational decisions.
